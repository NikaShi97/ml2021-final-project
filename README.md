# Comparison of two neural network architectures for tree species classification based on medium resolution multispectral and SAR remote sensing data

This is the final project of SHAVII team on Machine Learning course. The project performs implementation of the integer-order and fractional-order backpropagation algorithms to the multi-layered perceptron, which is chosen to be a classifier for tree species.
